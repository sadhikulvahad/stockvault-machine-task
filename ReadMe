Project Name
This project is a full-stack web application built with a React frontend and an Express backend. The frontend is developed using Vite and Tailwind CSS, while the backend uses TypeScript, Express, and various middleware for authentication, file uploads, and logging. The application is designed to [briefly describe the project's purpose or functionality, e.g., "manage user data with secure authentication and a responsive UI"].

Features

User authentication using JWT and bcrypt
File upload functionality with Multer
Responsive frontend built with React and Tailwind CSS
API requests handled with Axios
Real-time development with Vite and Nodemon

Technologies Used
Backend

Node.js with Express for the server
TypeScript for type-safe code
JWT (jsonwebtoken) for authentication
Bcrypt for password hashing
Multer for file uploads
Morgan for request logging
CORS for cross-origin resource sharing
Inversify for dependency injection
Reflect-metadata for metadata-driven development

Frontend

React with Vite for fast development and building
Tailwind CSS for styling
React Router for client-side routing
Axios for API requests
Lucide React for icons
Sonner for toast notifications
ESLint for code linting

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v18 or higher)
npm (v9 or higher)
Git (for cloning the repository)
A code editor like VS Code

Setup Instructions
Backend Setup

Clone the repository:git clone <your-github-repo-link>
cd server


Install dependencies:npm install


Create a .env file in the server directory with the following variables:PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

Replace your_jwt_secret with a secure secret key for JWT.
Build the project:npm run build


Run the development server (uses Nodemon for hot reloading):npm run dev

The backend will run on http://localhost:5000 (or the port specified in .env).

Frontend Setup

Navigate to the client directory:cd client


Install dependencies:npm install


Create a .env file in the client directory with the following:VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

This points the frontend to the backend API.
Run the development server:npm run dev

The frontend will run on http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port).

Running the Application

Start the backend:
In the server directory, run:npm run dev




Start the frontend:
In the client directory, run:npm run dev




Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view the application.

Accessing the Deployed Version
The live version of the project is hosted at:[Insert live link here, e.g., https://your-project-name.vercel.app]
Ensure the backend is also deployed (e.g., on Render, Heroku, or another platform) and update the VITE_API_URL in the frontend's .env file to point to the deployed backend API.
